# GEE Classification
## Code Structure:
    Configurations: related configuration about gee clissification model
    Data: It is a folder, which used to save raw dataset and processed dataset.
    Data process model：egg_process.py, read GEE dataset，and split dataset into train, val and test set.
    Data upload model：egg_dataset.py 
    Model：egg_network.py
    Train：eeg_train.py
